## üö® CRITICAL: Task Execution Workflow

**If user provides Notion URL:**

1. **NEVER use WebFetch**
2. **Read `AI_TASK_EXECUTION.md`**
3. **Follow 5-step workflow EXACTLY:**
   - `notion-tasks show <task-id>`
   - `notion-tasks update <task-id> -s "In Progress"`
   - Use EXACT todos from Notion
   - Update todos during development
   - Mark task as "Done" when finished

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW = TASK FAILURE**
