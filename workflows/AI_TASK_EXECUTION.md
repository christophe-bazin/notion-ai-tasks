# AI Task Execution Workflow

This guide is for AI assistants executing existing Notion tasks.

## üìù Configuration Variables

Values in `[brackets]` refer to configuration variables from `notion-tasks.config.json`:
- `[inProgressStatus]` ‚Üí Use value from `config.inProgressStatus`
- `[testStatus]` ‚Üí Use value from `config.testStatus` 
- `[completionStatus]` ‚Üí Use value from `config.completionStatus`
- `[defaultStatus]` ‚Üí Use value from `config.defaultStatus`
- `[from priorities array]` ‚Üí Use any value from `config.priorities` array
- `[from types array]` ‚Üí Use any value from `config.types` array

## üö® MANDATORY WORKFLOW

**Follow these steps EXACTLY in order:**

### Step 1: Get Task Specs
```bash
npx notion-ai-tasks show <task-id>
```
Extract task-id from URL: `https://www.notion.so/task-name-2270fffd93c2816c813cc1d32ad41a73` ‚Üí use `2270fffd93c2816c813cc1d32ad41a73`

### Step 2: Analysis & Comprehension
**CRITICAL: Do NOT proceed to Step 3 without completing this analysis phase.**

#### Context Analysis Checklist:
Before starting implementation, you MUST answer these questions:

**üìã Task Understanding:**
- [ ] What is the core business/technical objective of this task?
- [ ] Who is the target user/beneficiary of this implementation?
- [ ] What problem does this task solve?

**üîç Technical Analysis:**
- [ ] What components/files will likely need modification?
- [ ] Are there any technical dependencies or prerequisites?
- [ ] What is the estimated complexity level (simple/medium/complex)?
- [ ] Are the specifications complete and clear?

**üåê Project Context:**
- [ ] How does this task integrate with the existing codebase?
- [ ] Are there any potential conflicts with other features?
- [ ] What testing approach will be needed?
- [ ] Are there any security, performance, or compatibility considerations?

**‚ùì Clarification Needs:**
- [ ] Are there any ambiguous requirements that need clarification?
- [ ] Do I need additional information before proceeding?
- [ ] Should I ask the user any questions before starting?

#### Comprehension Validation:
Write a brief summary (2-3 sentences) of your understanding:
```
"I understand this task as [objective] which will [approach] to solve [problem]. 
The implementation will involve [key components] and requires [main considerations]."
```

#### Examples of Good Context Analysis:

**Example 1 - Bug Fix Task:**
```
Task: "User login fails with special characters in password"

Analysis:
‚úÖ Objective: Fix authentication system to handle special characters in passwords
‚úÖ Problem: Security validation is rejecting valid special characters  
‚úÖ Components: Auth middleware, password validation, possibly database layer
‚úÖ Complexity: Medium - requires security considerations
‚úÖ Testing: Need edge cases with various special characters

Comprehension: "I understand this task as a security bug fix which will modify the password validation logic to properly handle special characters. The implementation will involve auth middleware and validation functions and requires careful security testing."
```

**Example 2 - Feature Implementation:**
```
Task: "Add dark mode toggle to application settings"

Analysis:  
‚úÖ Objective: Implement theme switching functionality for better UX
‚úÖ Problem: Users need visual comfort option for different lighting conditions
‚úÖ Components: Settings UI, theme context, CSS variables, local storage
‚úÖ Complexity: Medium - requires global state management
‚úÖ Testing: Visual testing across components, persistence testing

Comprehension: "I understand this task as a UX enhancement which will implement global theme switching to solve user comfort needs. The implementation will involve React context, CSS variables, and local storage and requires comprehensive visual testing."
```

**Only proceed to Step 3 after completing this analysis and feeling confident in your understanding.**

### Step 3: Update Status IMMEDIATELY
```bash
npx notion-ai-tasks update <task-id> --status [inProgressStatus]
```

### Step 4: Analyze Task Structure & Organize Your Work
For complex Notion tasks, first analyze the hierarchical structure and follow progressive decomposition:

#### Check for Hierarchical Structure:
```bash
npx notion-ai-tasks hierarchical <task-id> --structure
```

#### For Tasks with Hierarchical Content:
If the task has nested sections or todos, use progressive decomposition:
```bash
npx notion-ai-tasks hierarchical <task-id> --progressive
```

**CRITICAL: Follow the generated progressive steps EXACTLY. Do NOT mix levels.**

**Progressive Execution Workflow:**
1. **Get the progressive steps** from the hierarchical command
2. **Execute each step individually** following the exact todo list provided
3. **Update Claude todos to match ONLY the current step** - don't mix with other levels
4. **Complete current step fully** before moving to next step

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Distinction:**
- **Claude todos** (`TodoWrite`) = Internal Claude tracking with status: `pending`/`in_progress`/`completed` *(Claude Code only)*
- **Notion todos** (`npx notion-ai-tasks todo`) = Actual task checkboxes in Notion database *(All AI assistants)*
- **Notion statuses** = Task-level statuses like `[inProgressStatus]`, `[testStatus]` from config *(All AI assistants)*

**Note for other AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, etc.):** Skip the `TodoWrite` examples - focus only on Notion todos and statuses.

**Example Progressive Execution:**
```javascript
// Generated Step 1: Overview
"Here are all the tasks to do"
Update todo
- [ ] Section 1
- [ ] Section 2  
- [ ] Section 3

// Claude todos for Step 1 ONLY (internal Claude tracking, not Notion statuses):
TodoWrite([
  {id: "1", content: "Section 1", status: "pending"},     // Claude status: pending/in_progress/completed
  {id: "2", content: "Section 2", status: "pending"},
  {id: "3", content: "Section 3", status: "pending"}
]);

// Generated Step 2: Focus on Section 1
"Working on Section 1"
Update todo
- [ ] Task 1.1
- [ ] Task 1.2

// Claude todos for Step 2 ONLY (internal Claude tracking, not Notion statuses):
TodoWrite([
  {id: "1", content: "Task 1.1", status: "in_progress"},   // Claude status: pending/in_progress/completed
  {id: "2", content: "Task 1.2", status: "pending"}
]);

// Generated Step 3: Section 1 completed - return to overview
"Section completed Section 1"
Update todo
- [x] Section 1  ‚úÖ
- [ ] Section 2
- [ ] Section 3

// Claude todos for Step 3 - overview with progress (internal Claude tracking):
TodoWrite([
  {id: "1", content: "Section 1", status: "completed"},   // Claude status: pending/in_progress/completed
  {id: "2", content: "Section 2", status: "pending"},
  {id: "3", content: "Section 3", status: "pending"}
]);

// Generated Step 4: Focus on Section 2
"Working on Section 2"  
Update todo
- [ ] Task 2.1
- [ ] Task 2.2

// Claude todos for Step 4 ONLY (internal Claude tracking, not Notion statuses):
TodoWrite([
  {id: "1", content: "Task 2.1", status: "in_progress"},   // Claude status: pending/in_progress/completed
  {id: "2", content: "Task 2.2", status: "pending"}
]);

// Generated Step 5: Section 2 completed - return to overview
"Section completed Section 2"
Update todo
- [x] Section 1  ‚úÖ
- [x] Section 2  ‚úÖ
- [ ] Section 3

// Claude todos for Step 5 - overview with progress (internal Claude tracking):
TodoWrite([
  {id: "1", content: "Section 1", status: "completed"},   // Claude status: pending/in_progress/completed
  {id: "2", content: "Section 2", status: "completed"},
  {id: "3", content: "Section 3", status: "pending"}
]);
```

#### For Simple Tasks:
For tasks without hierarchical structure, organize by simple sections:
```javascript
// Claude internal todo tracking (not Notion statuses):
TodoWrite([
  {id: "1", content: "Research requirements", status: "in_progress"},  // Claude status: pending/in_progress/completed
  {id: "2", content: "Implement solution", status: "pending"},
  {id: "3", content: "Test implementation", status: "pending"}
]);
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Generate progressive steps first** using hierarchical command
- **Follow generated steps exactly** - each step provides the complete todo list for that level
- **Match Claude todos to current step only** - don't carry forward other sections/levels
- **Return to overview after each section** - the system generates overview return steps automatically
- **Update section status progressively** - mark sections as completed when returning to overview
- **Complete current step fully** before advancing to next step
- **Never mix hierarchical levels** in Claude todos

### Step 5: Update Notion Todos IMMEDIATELY After Completion
```bash
# Mark each todo as complete right after you implement it
npx notion-ai-tasks todo <task-id> "todo text" true
```
**Important**: Mark each todo as complete immediately after implementing it, not at the end!

### Step 5.5: Add Additional Content if Needed
During execution, you MAY add additional content or todos if necessary for implementation:
```bash
# Add new todos discovered during development
npx notion-ai-tasks add-content <task-id> -c "Additional task discovered during implementation [+]"

# Add explanatory content
npx notion-ai-tasks add-content <task-id> -t "Implementation notes: [Details discovered during execution] [+]"
```
**Important**: Mark any added content with `[+]` to distinguish from original specifications.

### Step 6: Implementation Summary & Test Recommendations
When the task automatically moves to [testStatus] (all todos completed), provide a concise summary and testing guidance:

```bash
# Add implementation summary and test recommendations to task
npx notion-ai-tasks add-content <task-id> -c "## üß™ Implementation Summary & Testing Guide

### What was implemented:
- [Brief summary of key changes made]
- [Components/files modified]
- [New functionality added]

### Critical areas to test:
- [ ] [Specific functionality to verify]
- [ ] [Edge cases to check]
- [ ] [Integration points to validate]
- [ ] [Performance/security considerations]

### Test scenarios:
1. **Happy path:** [Expected normal behavior]
2. **Edge cases:** [Boundary conditions to test]
3. **Error handling:** [Failure scenarios to verify]

[+]"
```

### Step 7: Final Status Update
```bash
# Task automatically goes to [testStatus] when 100% complete
# Only mark as [completionStatus] manually after testing/validation
npx notion-ai-tasks update <task-id> -s [completionStatus]
```

## ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
- Never use WebFetch for Notion URLs
- Never skip step 2 (context analysis) or step 3 (status update)
- Never create your own todos without marking them [+]
- Never deviate from the core task specifications

## ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS
- Follow the exact workflow steps
- **Complete Step 2 analysis BEFORE proceeding** - understand the task context fully
- Use the todos from Notion
- **Mark todos as complete IMMEDIATELY** when you finish each one
- Update progress in real-time for better tracking
- Add additional content/todos if needed (mark with [+])
- **Provide implementation summary and test recommendations** when task moves to [testStatus]
- Task automatically moves to [testStatus] when todos are complete
- Only mark as [completionStatus] manually after testing/validation

## Example: Complete Workflow
```bash
# 1. Get task specs
npx notion-ai-tasks show 2270fffd93c2816c813cc1d32ad41a73

# 2. Analysis & Comprehension (MANDATORY)
# Complete the context analysis checklist and write comprehension summary
# Example: "I understand this task as implementing user authentication 
# which will add login/logout functionality to solve user access control. 
# The implementation will involve auth middleware, JWT tokens, and login UI 
# and requires security testing and session management."

# 3. Update status immediately  
npx notion-ai-tasks update 2270fffd93c2816c813cc1d32ad41a73 -s "In Progress"

# 4. Implement according to Notion task specs
# 5. Mark todos as complete IMMEDIATELY after implementing each one
npx notion-ai-tasks update-todo 2270fffd93c2816c813cc1d32ad41a73 "Setup database" -c true
npx notion-ai-tasks update-todo 2270fffd93c2816c813cc1d32ad41a73 "Create API endpoints" -c true
npx notion-ai-tasks update-todo 2270fffd93c2816c813cc1d32ad41a73 "Add unit tests" -c true

# 5.5. Add additional content if discovered during implementation
npx notion-ai-tasks add-content 2270fffd93c2816c813cc1d32ad41a73 -c "Add input validation for edge cases [+]"

# 6. Add implementation summary and test recommendations when task moves to Test
npx notion-ai-tasks add-content 2270fffd93c2816c813cc1d32ad41a73 -c "## üß™ Implementation Summary & Testing Guide
### What was implemented:
- JWT authentication system with login/logout endpoints
- User session management with secure token storage
- Input validation and error handling

### Critical areas to test:
- [ ] Login with valid/invalid credentials
- [ ] Token expiration and refresh
- [ ] Session persistence across browser restarts
- [ ] Security: SQL injection, XSS protection [+]"

# 7. Task automatically moves to "Test" when todos complete
# 8. Only mark as "Done" manually after testing/validation
npx notion-ai-tasks update 2270fffd93c2816c813cc1d32ad41a73 -s "Done"
```

**This workflow is MANDATORY. Do not deviate.**
